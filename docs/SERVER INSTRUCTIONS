Note: Whenever permission denied error occurs, use "sudo" in front of the command. Every time we run docker, it creates a new instance. The github repo is under catkin/src.

Open a terminal

ssh -X username@sarec2.crc.nd.edu
cd .. //navigate to /home directory
sudo ./run.sh (will launch a terminal with five tabs and a drone instance will run in each, currently blue, green, red, white and yellow)

In a new terminal, //terminal 2
ssh ..., 
cd ..
sudo ./color.sh color_name //this sends the json file
sudo ./color.sh blue (for instance)

We can see the outputs in the first terminal

If we git pull then we need to rebuild the docker using this:

sudo docker build .
It will generate a new_container_id, then
sudo docker tag new_container_id simulation
Then we are good unless new changes require additional configurations.
